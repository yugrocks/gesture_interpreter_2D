# Gesture interpreter (2D)
A simple model that interpretes hand-drawn gestures (like alphabets,numbers).
This program uses the pearson's correlation score to predict the type of curve.
The pretrained data is stored in a file named DATABASE.ser (in serialized form).
It can be made to learn about new curves and the features of each curve are stored in DATABASE.ser file.
